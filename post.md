🚀 Just Built a Containerized Microservices App with Docker Compose!

I recently completed a hands-on project that demonstrates a simple yet effective microservices architecture using:

🔹 Flask for lightweight REST APIs
🔹 PostgreSQL for persistent user data
🔹 Redis for fast caching
🔹 Docker Compose to orchestrate all services

🧩 The setup includes two Flask-based services:

user-service: handles user registration and stores data in PostgreSQL.

data-service: serves user data and uses Redis for caching.

Everything runs in isolated containers, connected through a custom Docker network — making the whole system modular, reproducible, and easy to scale.

If you're starting with containerized backend systems, this is a great project to learn service isolation and inter-service communication!
